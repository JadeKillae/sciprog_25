Chosen language: C

## To compile:

* gcc Conversion.c -o conversionc -lm
* gcc Sum.c -o sumc

## To execute:

* ./conversionc
* /sumc

## Output:

* Conversion:

  The number of digits is 25
  inum=33554431,  fnum=33554432.000000,  inum in binary=1111111111111111111111111

* Sum:

  Sum1=7.485478
  Sum2=7.485472
  Difference between the two is 0.000007
