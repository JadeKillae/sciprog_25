# Practical 8

This folder contains practical 08 codes. In this practical, we learn the difference between a iterative and recursive algorithms, by using them to calculate the gratest common divisor (GCD).

Chosen language: C

## To compile:

* gcc gcd.c -o gcd


## To execute:

* ./gcd

## Output examples (adapted in this readme file to make it look same as in terminal):

 * Please input two positive integers: 
 10 -2 3
 These numbers are not positive

 * Please input two positive integers: 
 10 2
 Iterative GCD(10, 2)=2
 Recursive GCD(10, 2)=2
