# Practical 9

This folder contains practical 09 codes. In this practical we read data from a file, and we practice using separate files for the functions ('magicsquare.h') and the main function ('main.c'). We read a matrix from a txt and with the function we detect if the matrix is a magic square or not.

Chosen language: C

## To compile:

* gcc main.c -o mainc

## To execute:

* ./main

## Output examples (adapted in this readme file to make it look same as in terminal):

 * Enter file name: magic_square.txt
 No. lines: 3
 this square is magic. 

 * Enter file name: not_magic_square.txt
 No. lines: 3
 this square is NOT magic.
