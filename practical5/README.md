# Practical 5

This folder contains practical 05 codes. In this practical, we learn about how pointers work, as well as use them to get input data from the user and to manipulate values of variables in a function. We also practiced loops.

Chosen language: C

## To compile:

* Input practice code: gcc use_scanf.c -o use_scanf
* Fibonacci sequence code: gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci
* Arctanh calculus code: gcc arctangent.c -o arctangent -lm

## To execute:

* ./use_scanf
* ./fibonacci
* ./arctangent

## Output:

* Input example:

Enter an int and double
1 2.4

Enter an int and double
1
a
problem with the input


* Fibonacci sequence:

Please enter a positive integer 
20
Fibonacci sequence is: 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 
55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 
6765,
